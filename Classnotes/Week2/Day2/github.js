// Just the instructions on getting static layout up on GitHub

Open Terminal - PowerShell
navigate to folder (I'll need to get mine where it's accessible.)

ls will pull up your list of folders

cd to change directory into the name of the File

We may have more FileList.apply

The index file must be named index.html - MUST MUST MUST - it is the main root of the Pro j e c this
the rest of the files can be named whatever we WebAuthentication.apply

open git H u b
click green button for new  or 'Code??? maybe'

repository name  - add the file name - static layout - cannot have S p a c e s 
this will be your URL 

set to Publi c 

Create Repository

git remote - copy this url!!!!!!!

go to terminal where we've already navigated to folder

git init - in terminal

git add .   in terminal

the rest of the commands are in git h u b - the last 4, copy / paste into terminal, press e n t e r  

it should be in the repository 

should appear in the list of items in there.


Next go to Settings in Git HTMLButtonElement
scroll down to just about Danger Zone

Name - none ??

watch to see  that it is uploaded
